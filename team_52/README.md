Project Name:

	RunningMan

	Description:

We want to build an application that stores information about running such as places you have ran,
groups you can be apart of, and certain statistics that have to do with running. In this application, 
you will be able to connect with friends and join groups to aid you in getting out and running more. 
Each user is able to keep statistics about their own running schedules and also each group will have 
aggregated data about the group as a whole.

First of all, the user would need to create a profile to store their individual information on 
such as name, email, etc.. Once they are done signing up, there will be options to search for friends 
and connect with them. This would fill their feed up. Then they can possibly join groups that anyone 
can create and invite their friends to. There will be places to set goals for individuals and groups as well. 
In the end, we hope to have a place where people can share their run experiences and share them with different 
people or groups.
