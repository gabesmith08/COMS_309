Project Name:

	RunningMan

Description:

	We want to build an application that stores information about running such as places you have ran,
	groups you can be apart of, and certain statistics that have to do with running. In this application, 
	you will be able to connect with friends and join groups to aid you in getting out and running more. 
	Each user is able to keep statistics about their own running schedules and also each group will have 
	aggregated data about the group as a whole.

	Initially, the user needs to create a profile to store their individual information on such as name, 
	email, etc.. Once they are done signing up, there are options to search for friends and 
	connect with them. This will fill their main "feed" up on the home page. Then they have the option to join 
	groups that anyone can create and invite their friends too. There are options to set goals for individuals 
	and groups as well. 


Technologies:

	Full stack mobile development. The front end was implemented in Java/XML with the Android Studio IDE, while the 
	back end was Springboot Framework and mySQL. For location features of the app we used a Google maps api.
